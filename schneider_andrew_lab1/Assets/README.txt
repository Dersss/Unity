README.txt for Andrew Schneider.911 Lab1 Submission

My game is a simple game where all you need to do is collect the moving cube. This is the first time
that i have used unity and enjoyed it thoroughly. I wanted to make the scene take place in a bench in
the park or on a golf course with extra large GameObjects around but it's a little beyond my skill level.
The controls are as follows:
    Movement: W-A-S-D
    Sprint: Hold Left Shift
    Jump: Space Bar
The ending effect is that the string "You win!" appears in green. Though i did add some fire and spot 
lights to make it look better. Thanks for playing!
